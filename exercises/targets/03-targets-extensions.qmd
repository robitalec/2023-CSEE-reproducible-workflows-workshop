## High-performance computing

You can also run {targets} workflows using various high-performance computing options. 

- through the {future} package with [`tar_make_future()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_make_future.html)
- through the {clustermq} with the [`tar_make_clustermq()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_make_clustermq.html). 

`tar_make()` also integrates with the [{crew}](https://github.com/wlandau/crew) package which will become the predominant high-performance computing approach for {targets} moving forward (see [NEWS {targets} 1.0.0](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/main/NEWS.md#targets-100)).

## Recommendations
TODO

start your next project with targets, easier to start then refactor a whole project especially if it isnt using functions


## Bonus
TODO

format = file
tar_option_set
- fs 
- error
