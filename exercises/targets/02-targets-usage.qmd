# Usage

Now that we have our `_targets.R` script setup with the previous exercises and we have added our first few targets to the workflow, let's take a look at using {targets}. It is a bit different than the [usual R approach](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/#motivation) where we make edits, then rerun everything, wait for results, notice issues, rerun from scratch...

The following functions allow us to interact with the workflow's definition, metadata and results. Because of this, we shouldn't put them inside the `_targets.R` script or in our `R/` directory. Often {targets} workflows will result in a rendered document or manuscript, a number of saved plots or an output data file. 

In our case, let's make a new script called `explore.R` in the root of the project's directory. Then we can keep track of our commands like `tar_meta()`, `tar_visnetwork()` and `tar_read()`, and easily rerun them when we make changes to the workflow. 

Instruction: make a empty script called `explore.R` in the root of the project's directory. At the top, load the packages and/or the functions with `source()` or `tar_source()`.

`explore.R`

```r
library(targets)
tar_source('R')
```

## `tar_visnetwork()`


### Exercise: `tar_visnetwork()`



also see `tar_glimpse()`, `tar_mermaid()`, `tar_network()`


## `tar_make()`

isolated environment



Extra

could also make run distributed locally, with {future}, with {clustermq}

### Exercise: `tar_make()`


## `tar_read()`, `tar_load()`


### Exercise: `tar_read()`, `tar_load()`


## Edits, rerun, edits, ... 

The approach now that we have a {targets} workflow setup is a bit different than you might be used to using R interactively. With a {targets} workflow, everything is defined in the workflow so our process is now about making edits to our functions and our `_targets.R` workflow, then rerunning `tar_make()`, making edits, ... 


### Exercise: practice the {targets} approach

Instruction: Make an edit, run tar_make, look at results, make an edit, run tar make

TODO where to look at results


## Bonus

Also make targets for plotting the weather timeseries and the palmer penguins

Add a new target for something that isnt our function, what about `summary()` or any other common function
note that targets dont need to be custom functions, any R command can be used in a target
