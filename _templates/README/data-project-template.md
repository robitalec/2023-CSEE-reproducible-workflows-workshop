------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Description (abstract):** What is your project about? What is the goal? Why are you doing it? How does this data relate to your project?

**Title:** What do you want to call your data set?

**Permanent Identifier:** A way for folks to find your data. Do you have a DOI or other permanent identifier?

**Data Source:** If you included someone else's data in your data set, provide information on where it came from. Just like articles, if you use it, cite it. It is preferable to include a permanent identifier like a DOI.

**Subject:** In what discipline or subject area is your project?

**Related publication:** Have you published an article, thesis or some other publication based on this data? Include a full citation and permanent identifier, if available.

**Data Collector:** Person/organization responsible for collecting data

**Funder Information** : Is this project sponsored by a funding agency? If so, include name of the funding agency, grant number, and principal investigator name/s & affiliations.

**Publication Date:** When was the data made available in the place of publication (above)? Again, use the international standard date format.

**Data collection process:** What instruments were used to collect the data? how frequently were the data collected? how were data collection sites selected? if there was a sample population, how was it selected?

**Data processing:** How did you clean the data? how are missing or null values handled? did you write code for processing the data and where can it be found?

**File index:** A listing of folders and files included in the data set. Explain what files will be found in each folder and naming conventions used. Additional files could include any questionnaires or other survey instruments used to collect the data. Be sure to include codebooks and data dictionaries or similar README files.

**File format/s:** What type/s of files are these? Are there multiple formats? What software is needed to use the file/s?
