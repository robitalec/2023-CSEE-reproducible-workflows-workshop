Developing a reproducible workflow in R using functions, targets and renv


## Data

Example data for this workshop is borrowed from the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER). Here is the study description from the [Palmer LTER site](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/):

>  The Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) study area is located to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula extending South and North of the Palmer Basin from onshore to several hundred kilometers off shore. Palmer Station is one of the three United States research stations located in Antarctica. It is on Anvers Island midway down the Antarctic Peninsula at latitude 64.7 South, longitude 64.0 West.

> The Palmer LTER studies a polar marine biome with research focused on the Antarctic pelagic marine ecosystem, including sea ice habitats, regional oceanography and terrestrial nesting sites of seabird predators. The Palmer LTER is one of more than 26 LTER research sites located throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and Tahiti; each focused on a specific ecosystem, that together constitute the LTER Network.

We gratefully acknowledge the Palmer LTER for releasing data freely and openly for diverse uses - in our case for training analytical skills of researchers in ecology.
