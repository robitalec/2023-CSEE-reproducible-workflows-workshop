    - "improving reach as a data scientist"
    - "automate common tasks"
    - three big advantages
        - give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand
        - as requirements change, only need to update code in one place instead of many
        - eliminate chance of incremental mistakes when copy pasting 
    - other advantages
        - easier to apply over groups or chunks in data, eg. by individual with lapply/map/data.table's by
    - when to write? 
        - when you've copy pasted more than twice
    - steps
        - develop code for accomplishing the task
        - analyse the code
            - how many inputs
            - look for duplication, eg. calculating the mean multiple times
                - save as intermediate value
        - pick a name 
        - list inputs
        - list arguments
        - place developed code in body of the function
        - check results with eg. NAs, missing values, known results
    - naming
        - snake_case
        - common prefix eg input_select, input_checkbox, input_text
        - dont override existing functions (see conflicted later)
    - conditionals 
        - if else (else if)
        - `||` `&&` combine multiple logical expressions and short-circuit when `||` sees the first true and `&&` sees the first false
        - `|` `&` are vectorized and cannot be directly used in an if unless you also use any / all
    - calling functions
    - checking values
        - stopifnot
        - if else then stop
    - return
        - always last thing 
        - otherwise explicit return
    - environment
        - lexical scoping
            - if variable isnt available in the functions environment, will look in environment where function was defined 
            - in a simple case, eg f(x) {x + y}, this means `y`, but also `{` and `+`
            - if `+` is reassigned it will be used, meaning you can override a function from eg. base R

- iteration (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html)
    - we'll use targets' dynamic and static branching instead
    - iterating over a single list/vector/etc
        - for loops
        - purrr::map    
    - multiple inputs
        - purrr::map2
    - loop for side effects
        - purrr::walk
    - managing errors
        - safely
        - try
        - possibly
        - quietly


Advanced R

- functions https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html
    - three components of a function
        - arguments (`formals()`): arguments used to control the function
        - body (`body()`): code inside the function
        - environment (`environment()`): determins how function finds values associated with names
            - implicit based on where you defined the function
            - 
    - functions are objects
    - primitive functions
        - only found in the base package
        - eg. sum, `[`
        - they are the exceptions to above, for primitive functions the following  return NULL `formals()`, `body()`, `environment()`
        - primitive functions indicated by typeof(f) is "builtin" or "special"
    - anonymous functions are used without first assigning them 
    - do.call if you have arguments already in a list 
    - combining functions
        - nesting `f(g(x))` is concise, good for short sequences but hard to read (right to left, inside out)
        - intermediate objects, requires naming each intermediate object, useful when independent objects are useful otherwise not
        - pipes let you run and function *and then* then next one *and then* the next one (...) in a chain
    - lexical scoping
        - name masking

    
- functional programming (https://adv-r.hadley.nz/fp.html)
    - R is at its heart a functional language
        - functional languages have:
            1. first-class functions that behave like any other data structure. you can assign to variables, store them in lists, pass them as arguments, etc
            2. functions that are pure. pure functions satisfy two properties - 1) outputs depend only on inputs where rerunning the function with the same inputs will yield the same results, and 2) functions have no side-effects like changing global variables, writing to disk, displaying to the screen
        - for R, functions are ideally either very pure, or very impure (plotting, saving, etc)
    - functionals are functions that take a function as input and returns a vector as output
        - eg. lapply, apply, tapply, purrr::map
        - commonly used as an alternative to for loops
        - (lots of great background)
    - function factories
        - eg. power1 <- function(exp) function(x) x ^ exp, square <- power1(2)
        - (beyond scope of workshop)
    - function operators


- control flow (https://adv-r.hadley.nz/control-flow.html)
    - choices
        - if (condition) true_action
        - if (condition) true_action else false_action
        - also else if
        - must be length 1
        - switch (https://adv-r.hadley.nz/control-flow.html#switch)
            - more compact than a bunch of simple if else if else 
    - loops
        - for
            - caution 1:length if length 0, alternatively use seq_along, seq.int etc
        - while
        - repeat





Exercises

- turn this into a function
    - from code
    - from description of function eg. takes a vector and does XYZ
- control flow
    - build an if else
    - use an argument in an if else 
- what does this function do
    - on slide
    - in R with view source
- scoping (what will this function return)
    - eg https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#lexical-scoping
