    - "improving reach as a data scientist"
    - "automate common tasks"
    - three big advantages
        - give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand
        - as requirements change, only need to update code in one place instead of many
        - eliminate chance of incremental mistakes when copy pasting 
    - other advantages
        - easier to apply over groups or chunks in data, eg. by individual with lapply/map/data.table's by
    - when to write? 
        - when you've copy pasted more than twice
    - steps
        - develop code for accomplishing the task
        - analyse the code
            - how many inputs
            - look for duplication, eg. calculating the mean multiple times
                - save as intermediate value
        - pick a name 
        - list inputs
        - list arguments
        - place developed code in body of the function
        - check results with eg. NAs, missing values, known results
