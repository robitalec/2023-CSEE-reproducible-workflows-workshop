## File Structure

## README

-   A README file can act as a type of metadata (see below): it facilitates people using your data, script, etc.
-   There are basic requirements from a README in order to make your work usable (highlighted in our Think/Pair/Share exercise)

[ARDC Metadata Guide](https://zenodo.org/record/6459832) In order to use data, we need to know:

-   how the data is structured what it describes

-   how to read it (e.g. column headings and units)

-   methodological information such as instrument settings and calibrations, reagents used, or survey questions

-   exactly what they are allowed to do with the data through rights metadata such as licensing

-   how to acknowledge the original creators by citing the data

[Reproducible Quantitative Methods](https://cbahlai.github.io/rqm-template/lessons/week3/) Metadata is required for open data, by making a [data reuse plan](https://github.com/mozillascience/working-open-workshop/blob/gh-pages/handouts/data_reuse_plan_template.md) we can ensure that our data is usable for other people, [into the future](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kZd-ZD5lru5a7jIbyi9q8cBYCCAKRnIBSRvixYFtoF0/edit#slide=id.g1088c5b110_0_183).

Metadata should warn users about problems/inconsistencies in the data and provide checks to make sure data is functioning properly ([White et al., 2013](https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/IEE/article/download/4608/4898))

Cornell University [best practices](https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme) provides a [README template](https://cornell.app.box.com/v/ReadmeTemplate) that is free to adapt, alter, and use
